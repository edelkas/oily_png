Add Drawing module
Code regular rect method, and if it's just as fast as the fast_rect method, then leave just that one
Try to see why fast_compose is not faster than compose
Add C versions for flipping hor/ver
Perhaps translate part of the Ruby screenshot generation code directly to C (e.g. object composition, to save the function calls)
